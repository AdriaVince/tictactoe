# tictactoe
This is a tictactoe game to play in cmd

first open a new notepad tab and paste the code I have provided, then save the file as (name).bat and in all files instead of text documents.
If you had saved it to your desktop then it should have showed up and if you double click it, it will come up and you need to pick your skill level and then use the numbers of your keyboard to play then if you win/tie/lose then you type the letter Y or N depending on if you want to play again.

enjoy
